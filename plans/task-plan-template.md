## Instructions for the Human Project Manager

Your role is to be the "product owner" and "quality assurance" for this project. You will be responsible for:

1.  **Reviewing and Approving Task Plans:** Before I begin work on a task, I will create a task plan using the template below. You should review this plan to ensure that it aligns with your goals and that the proposed solution is sound.
2.  **Providing Feedback:** As I am working on a task, I may have questions or need clarification. Your timely and clear feedback will be essential to keeping the project on track.
3.  **Verifying Task Completion:** Once I have completed a task, I will ask you to verify that all the acceptance criteria have been met. This is a crucial step to ensure that we are building a high-quality application.
4.  **Maintaining the "Big Picture":** While I am focused on the individual tasks, you should keep the "big picture" in mind. If you see any potential issues or have any new ideas, please don't hesitate to bring them up.
