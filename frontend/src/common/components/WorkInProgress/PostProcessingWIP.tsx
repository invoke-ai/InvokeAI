        Invoke AI offers a wide variety of post processing features. Image
        Upscaling and Face Restoration are already available in the WebUI. You
        can access them from the Advanced Options menu of the Text To Image and
        Image To Image tabs. You can also process images directly, using the
        image action buttons above the current image display or in the viewer.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dedicated UI will be released soon to facilitate more advanced post
        processing workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Invoke AI Command Line Interface offers various other features
        including Embiggen.
