# Phase 3 Work Log: Dockview Integration

## Overview
Implementing Phase 3 of the Canvas Multi-Instance Implementation Plan:
- Section 3.1: Update Canvas Tab Layout to support multiple workspace panels
- Section 3.2: Add Canvas Management Actions component

## Progress

### 3.0 Initial Setup
- âœ… Created phase3_worklog.md
- âœ… Examined current canvas-tab-auto-layout.tsx structure  
- âœ… Found WORKSPACE_PANEL_ID and panel creation pattern in initializeCenterPanelLayout
- âœ… Examined canvasesSlice Redux structure - canvasInstanceAdded/Removed actions available
- âœ… Examined selectors - selectCanvasInstance, selectActiveCanvasId available
- âœ… Examined CanvasWorkspacePanel structure

### 3.1 Update Canvas Tab Layout
- âœ… Modified initializeCenterPanelLayout to create first canvas instance with canvasId
- âœ… Added nanoid import and Redux dispatch for canvas creation
- âœ… Added active panel change tracking to update active canvas in Redux
- âœ… Updated DockviewPanelParameters type to include optional canvasId

### 3.2 Add Canvas Management Actions  
- âœ… Created CanvasInstanceManager component with add canvas functionality
- âœ… Added canvas count selector to Redux selectors
- âœ… Integrated CanvasInstanceManager into CanvasToolbar
- âœ… Implemented basic UI with canvas count display and add button
- ðŸ”„ Panel creation currently limited to Redux state (dockview integration deferred)

## Implementation Notes
- Following existing code conventions in the codebase
- Making atomic commits after each meaningful change
- Running from /home/bat/git/InvokeAI/invokeai/frontend/web/ directory
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to panel props and selector updates
- Simplified CanvasInstanceManager to avoid dockview API access issues
- Used existing withPanelContainer pattern for CanvasWorkspacePanel

## Key Technical Decisions
- Deferred full dockview API integration due to API access complexity
- Used existing active canvas system from Phases 1-2 for compatibility
- Added canvasId parameter support to DockviewPanelParameters for future use
- Integrated CanvasInstanceManager into existing CanvasToolbar

## Remaining Work
- Complete dockview panel dynamic creation (requires API access pattern)
- Add proper canvas instance context for panel-specific state access
- Implement close canvas functionality with confirmation dialogs
