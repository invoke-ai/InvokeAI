# Phase 1: Redux State Architecture Refactoring - Work Log

## Overview
Implementing Phase 1 of the Canvas Multi-Instance Implementation Plan to refactor Redux state architecture.

## Progress Tracking

### 1.1 Canvas Instance Slice Creation
- [ ] Extract drawing-related reducers from canvasSlice
- [ ] Create canvasInstanceSlice.ts with Undoable wrapper
- [ ] Implement initial state and core reducers

### 1.2 Canvases Management Slice
- [ ] Rename/transform canvasSlice to canvasesSlice
- [ ] Implement multi-instance management
- [ ] Add routing and active canvas management

### 1.3 Selector Updates
- [ ] Update selectors for new state shape
- [ ] Handle Undoable state structure
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

### 1.4 Migration Script
- [ ] Create migration script for existing state
- [ ] Implement backward compatibility helpers
- [ ] Test migration functionality

## Work Session Log

### Session Start: 2025-09-02
- Starting Phase 1 implementation
- Created work log file
- Examined current canvasSlice structure

#### Analysis of Current State:
- Current canvasSlice has 1819 lines with extensive drawing-related reducers
- Canvas state structure includes: rasterLayers, controlLayers, regionalGuidance, inpaintMasks, bbox, selectedEntityIdentifier, bookmarkedEntityIdentifier
- Current selector structure uses `state.canvas.present` indicating it's already wrapped with redux-undo
- Need to extract all drawing-related reducers to new canvasInstanceSlice
- Current undoable config is at line 1750-1766

#### Starting 1.1: Canvas Instance Slice Creation
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Created canvasInstanceSlice.ts
- Extracted all drawing-related reducers from canvasSlice.ts (1000+ lines)
- Implemented undoable wrapper with redux-undo
- Added action throttling filter for performance
- Exported instanceActions and undoableCanvasInstanceReducer

#### Starting 1.2: Canvases Management Slice
