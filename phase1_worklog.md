# Phase 1: Redux State Architecture Refactoring - Work Log

## Overview
Implementing Phase 1 of the Canvas Multi-Instance Implementation Plan.

## Tasks
- [x] 1.0: Create work log file
- [x] 1.1: Create `canvasInstanceSlice.ts` - Extract drawing-related reducers
- [x] 1.2: Create `canvasesSlice.ts` - Transform canvasSlice to manage multiple instances  
- [x] 1.3: Update selectors for new Undoable state shape
- [x] 1.4: Create migration script for backward compatibility

## âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE

## Progress Log

### 2025-09-02 - Initial Setup
- Created work log file
- Examined current canvasSlice.ts structure (1819 lines with extensive drawing-related reducers)
- Examined CanvasState type definition

### 2025-09-02 - Phase 1.1 Complete
- âœ… Created canvasInstanceSlice.ts (1614 lines)
- Extracted all drawing-related reducers from canvasSlice
- Wrapped with redux-undo for isolated history per canvas instance
- Includes throttling filter to prevent excessive undo entries
- Committed: "feat(canvas): create canvasInstanceSlice for single canvas instance state"

### 2025-09-02 - Phase 1.2 Complete  
- âœ… Created canvasesSlice.ts (215 lines)
- Router pattern forwards instanceActions to correct canvas via extraReducers
- Undo/redo actions support both active canvas and specific canvasId
- Canvas instance lifecycle management (add/remove/activate)
- Global actions like canvasReset and modelChanged affect all instances
- Committed: "feat(canvas): create canvasesSlice as router for multiple canvas instances"

### 2025-09-02 - Phase 1.3 Complete
- âœ… Updated selectors.ts for new Undoable state shape
- Replaced legacy createCanvasSelector with createActiveCanvasSelector
- Added null checks for array operations in entity selectors
- Updated undo/redo selectors to access present/past/future from Undoable state
- Committed: "feat(canvas): update selectors for new Undoable state shape"

### 2025-09-02 - Phase 1.4 Complete & Phase 1 COMPLETE ðŸŽ‰
- âœ… Enhanced migration script with proper TypeScript types
- Fixed canvasesSlice.ts imports and added slice configuration
- Added canvasesSliceConfig with schema validation and migration support
- Fixed syntax errors and completed backward compatibility
- Committed: "feat(canvas): complete Phase 1.4 - migration script and slice config"

## Phase 1 Summary
**Total commits:** 4
**Total lines changed:** ~2000+ lines
**Key achievements:**
- Complete Redux state architecture refactoring for multi-canvas support
- Isolated undo/redo histories per canvas instance using redux-undo
- Router pattern for action forwarding to specific canvas instances
- Backward compatibility via migration scripts
- Updated selectors with null-safety for new state shape

**Ready for Phase 2: Canvas Manager Factory Pattern** ðŸš€
