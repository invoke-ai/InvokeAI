# Phase 5 Work Log - Generation Pipeline Updates

**Objective**: Update generation pipeline (readiness checks and enqueue hook) to work with active canvas instance from Redux

## Tasks

### 5.1 Update Readiness Checks
- [ ] Find and examine `readiness.ts` file
- [ ] Update `getReasonsWhyCannotEnqueueCanvasTab` to use active canvas ID
- [ ] Use `selectActiveCanvasId` and `selectActiveCanvas` selectors
- [ ] Ensure readiness checks only apply to active canvas instance

### 5.2 Update Enqueue Hook
- [ ] Find and examine `useEnqueueCanvas.ts` hook
- [ ] Update to use active canvas ID and manager from Redux
- [ ] Ensure generation only happens for active canvas
- [ ] Use `selectActiveCanvasId` selector and canvas manager registry

## Progress Log

### Initial Setup
- ✅ Created work log file
- ✅ Read implementation plan sections 5.1 and 5.2
- ✅ Found and examined readiness.ts file location
- ✅ Found and examined useEnqueueCanvas.ts hook location

### 5.1 Readiness Checks Update
- ✅ Updated UpdateReasonsArg type to use activeCanvasId, activeCanvas, and canvasManagers
- ✅ Updated debouncedUpdateReasons to extract new parameters
- ✅ Updated canvas tab branch to pass active canvas parameters
- ✅ Updated useReadinessWatcher to use active canvas selectors and managers registry
- ✅ Updated getReasonsWhyCannotEnqueueCanvasTab function signature and logic
- ✅ Added null checks for activeCanvasId and canvas/manager initialization
- ✅ Fixed variable naming conflicts and TypeScript errors

### 5.2 Enqueue Hook Update
- ✅ Updated useEnqueueCanvas hook to use selectActiveCanvasId
- ✅ Added activeCanvasId to dependency array and null check
- ✅ Enhanced error logging for missing active canvas

### Issues Found
- Several TypeScript errors due to null handling in selectors
- Need to run TypeScript checks and fix remaining issues
- Components expecting non-null canvas values need updates

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining TypeScript compilation errors
2. Run tests to ensure generation pipeline works
3. Make atomic commits for changes
