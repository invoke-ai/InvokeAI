# TypeScript Fixes Work Log

## Overview
Fixing TypeScript errors in the multi-instance canvas implementation after refactoring from singleton to multi-instance architecture.

## Key Architecture Changes
- `canvasSlice.ts` was split into:
  - `canvasInstanceSlice.ts` - contains drawing operations/reducers (exported as `instanceActions`)
  - `canvasesSlice.ts` - router that manages multiple instances, exports `canvasUndo`, `canvasRedo`, `canvasClearHistory`

## Current Status
Started: 2025-09-02

## Errors to Fix

### Import/Export Errors (Priority 1 - Runtime Breaking)
- ❌ `RasterLayerMenuItemsConvertToSubMenu.tsx`: Missing `rasterLayerConvertedToControlLayer`, `rasterLayerConvertedToInpaintMask`, `rasterLayerConvertedToRegionalGuidance` 
- ❌ `RasterLayerMenuItemsCopyToSubMenu.tsx`: Same missing exports as above
- ❌ Various components importing actions from wrong slice locations

### Type Errors (Priority 2)
- ❌ Control adapter null checks and missing properties (`beginEndStepPct`, `controlMode`)
- ❌ Canvas null checks across multiple files
- ❌ Dockview panel header `title` property missing
- ❌ Settings accordion property access errors

### Fixes Applied
- ✅ **Import/Export Errors Fixed (2 commits)**
  - Added missing `rasterLayerConverted*` action exports to canvasInstanceSlice
  - Added missing bbox, entity, and drawing action exports
  - Fixed `canvasClearHistory` import in imageActions to come from canvasesSlice  
  - Fixed `rgAdded` export name (was incorrectly exported as `regionalGuidanceAdded`)
  
- ✅ **Null Check and Type Safety Fixes (3 commits)** 
  - Fixed null checks for canvas manager and bbox selectors
  - Fixed control adapter null checks and type guards
  - Fixed dockview panel header title property access
  - Added null checks for canvas selectors in RegionalGuidance components
  - Fixed saveCanvasHooks getBbox null check and missing useAppDispatch import

## Status Summary
**Major improvements achieved:** ✅
- All critical runtime-breaking import/export errors have been resolved
- Core null pointer issues in canvas managers and components are fixed
- Control adapter type safety issues resolved
- UI component type mismatches (dockview) fixed

**Remaining work:** 
- Several canvas null selector type errors remain across various hook/component files
- These are lower priority and mostly follow the same pattern (add null checks to selectors)
- The application should now run without runtime import failures

**Impact:** The multi-instance canvas implementation should now function correctly without the critical TypeScript errors that were causing runtime failures.
