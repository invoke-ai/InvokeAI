         will override corresponding autoassigned probe fields in the
         model's config record as described in `import_model()`.
        :param access_token: Optional access token for remote sources.

        The source can be:
        1. A local file path in posix() format (`/foo/bar` or `C:\foo\bar`)
        2. An http or https URL (`https://foo.bar/foo`)
        3. A HuggingFace repo_id (`foo/bar`, `foo/bar:fp16`, `foo/bar:fp16:vae`)

        We extend the HuggingFace repo_id syntax to include the variant and the
        subfolder or path. The following are acceptable alternatives:
            stabilityai/stable-diffusion-v4
            stabilityai/stable-diffusion-v4:fp16
            stabilityai/stable-diffusion-v4:fp16:vae

            stabilityai/stable-diffusion-v4:onnx:vae

        Because a local file path can look like a huggingface repo_id, the logic
        first checks whether the path exists on disk, and if not, it is treated as
        a parseable huggingface repo.

        The previous support for recursing into a local folder and loading all model-like files
        has been removed.
