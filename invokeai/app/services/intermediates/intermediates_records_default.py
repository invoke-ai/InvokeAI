"""Storage of the intermediates manager.

One classification expression decides what every intermediate is under the cleanup policy (see
`queries/intermediates.py`), whether it aggregates a summary, describes a preview, pages an operation or guards
a delete.

A preview freezes the instant its recency is judged at; the operation it confirms and the guard on every
deleting transaction classify with that same recency cutoff and a live clock for everything else. Anything
created after the preview is newer than its cutoff, so it stays ``recent`` for the whole operation. Cached-output
holds are judged the same way by the operation itself, but the hold table is shared with live-clock callers
(summaries, cache hits) that may drop a hold once its grace has passed live; that only ever drops a hold whose
grace is over.

Queue inputs are found by scanning each active item's stored session for media-name keys; the scan is cached
per item, so a queue of a thousand pending items is parsed once, not per query.
