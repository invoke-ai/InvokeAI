/**
 * We need to manage focus regions to conditionally enable hotkeys:
 * - Some hotkeys should only be enabled when a specific region is focused.
 * - Some hotkeys may conflict with other regions, so we need to disable them when a specific region is focused. For
 *  example, `esc` is used to clear the gallery selection, but it is also used to cancel a filter or transform on the
 *  canvas.
 *
 * To manage focus regions, we use a system of hooks and stores:
 * - `useFocusRegion` is a hook that registers an element as part of a focus region. When that element is focused, by
 *  click or any other action, that region is set as the focused region. Optionally, focus can be set on mount. This
 *  is useful for components like the image viewer.
 * - `useIsRegionFocused` is a hook that returns a boolean indicating if a specific region is focused.
 * - `useFocusRegionWatcher` is a hook that listens for focus events on the window. When an element is focused, it
 *  checks if it is part of a focus region and sets that region as the focused region.
