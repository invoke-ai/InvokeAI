Workflows allow you to link multiple **Nodes** together to create custom, repeatable image generation processes. By connecting the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others, you can build complex functionality tailored to your specific needs.

## The Node Editor

With nodes, you can easily extend the image generation capabilities of InvokeAI. All InvokeAI features are added through nodes.

You can read more about nodes and how to use the node editor by checking out the detailed node documentation:
