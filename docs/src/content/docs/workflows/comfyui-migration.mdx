If you're coming to InvokeAI from ComfyUI, welcome! You'll find things are similar but different - the good news is that you already know how things should work, and it's just a matter of wiring them up!

<Card title="Node Granularity" icon="information">
  InvokeAI's nodes tend to be more granular than default nodes in Comfy. This means each node in Invoke will do a specific task, and you might need to use multiple nodes to achieve the same result. The added granularity improves the control you have over your workflows.
</Card>
<Card title="Backend Differences" icon="puzzle">
  InvokeAI's backend and ComfyUI's backend are very different, which means Comfy workflows are not able to be imported directly into InvokeAI. However, we have created a [list of popular workflows](/workflows/community-nodes) for you to get started with Nodes in InvokeAI!
