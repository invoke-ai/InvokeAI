The Gallery Panel is a fast way to review, find, and make use of images you've generated and loaded. The Gallery is divided into **Boards**. The *Uncategorized* board is always present, but you can create your own for better organization.

## Board Display and Settings

At the very top of the Gallery Panel, you will find the board disclosure and settings buttons.

![Top Controls](./assets/top_controls.png)

The **disclosure button** shows the name of the currently selected board and allows you to toggle the visibility of the board thumbnails.

The **settings button** opens a list of customization options:

![Board Settings](./assets/board_settings.png)

- **Image Size:** A slider that lets you control the size of the image previews in the gallery.
- **Auto-Switch to New Images:** When enabled, newly generated images will automatically load into the current image panel (on the Text to Image tab) or the result panel (on the Image to Image tab). This happens invisibly even if you are on a different tab during generation.
- **Auto-Assign Board on Click:** Whenever an image is generated or saved, it is placed into a board. The destination board is marked with an `AUTO` badge.
  - *When enabled:* The board selected at the moment you click **Invoke** becomes the destination. This allows you to queue multiple generations into different boards without waiting for them to finish.
  - *When disabled:* An **Auto-Add Board** dropdown appears, allowing you to set one specific board as the permanent destination for all new images.
- **Always Show Image Size Badge:** Toggles whether the resolution (e.g., 512x512) is displayed on each image preview thumbnail.

Below these buttons is the **Search Boards** text entry area, allowing you to quickly find specific boards by name. Next to it is the **Add Board (+)** button for creating new boards.

:::tip
You can rename any board by simply clicking on its name under the thumbnail and typing the new name.

## Board Management

Each board has a context menu accessible via right-click (or Ctrl+click).

![Thumbnail Menu](./assets/thumbnail_menu.png)

- **Auto-add to this Board:** If *Auto-Assign Board on Click* is disabled in settings, use this option to quickly set the selected board as the default destination for new images.
- **Download Board:** Packages all images within the board into a `.zip` file. A notification link will be provided when the download is ready.
- **Delete Board:** Permanently removes the board and all of its contents.

:::danger
Deleting a board will **permanently delete all images** contained within it. Proceed with caution!

### Board Contents

Every board is organized into two distinct tabs:

![Board Tabs](./assets/board_tabs.png)

1. **Images:** Images generated directly within InvokeAI.
2. **Assets:** External images you have uploaded to use as an [Image Prompt](https://support.invoke.ai/support/solutions/articles/151000159340-using-the-image-prompt-adapter-ip-adapter-) or within the Image to Image tab.

## Image Interaction

Every image generated by InvokeAI stores its generation metadata (prompt, seed, models, etc.) directly inside the file. You can read this data by selecting the image and clicking the **Info button** ![Info Button](./assets/info_button.png) in any result panel.

Additionally, each image has a context menu (right-click or Ctrl+click) with powerful workflow actions:

*Options marked with an asterisk (\*) require the image to have generation metadata.*

  </Card>
  <Card title="Organization" icon="list-format">
    - **Change Board:** Opens a prompt to move the image. *(You can also drag and drop images onto board thumbnails).*
    - **Delete Image:** Permanently deletes the image from InvokeAI.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
