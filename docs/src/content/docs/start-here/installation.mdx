## Invoke Launcher

The Invoke launcher is the official launcher to install, update and manage your invoke installation.

      2. Run the `EXE` to install the Launcher and start it.
      3. A desktop shortcut will be created; use this to run the Launcher in the future.
      4. You can delete the `EXE` file you downloaded.
    </Steps>

      2. You may need to edit the `AppImage` file properties and make it executable.
      3. Optionally move the file to a location that does not require admin privileges and add a desktop shortcut for it.
      4. Run the Launcher by double-clicking the `AppImage` or the shortcut you made.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Install Invoke

Run the Launcher you just set up if you haven't already. Click **Install** and follow the instructions to install (or update) Invoke.

If you have an existing Invoke installation, you can select it and let the launcher manage the install. You'll be able to update or launch the installation.

:::note[Updating]
  The Launcher will check for updates for itself _and_ Invoke.

  - When the Launcher detects an update is available for itself, you'll get a small popup window. Click through this and the Launcher will update itself.
  - When the Launcher detects an update for Invoke, you'll see a small green alert in the Launcher. Click that and follow the instructions to update Invoke.

## Alternative Launchers

:::caution
  Installations from alternate launchers are not managed by Invoke, so we cannot guarantee it will work correctly. If you want a more stable experience, we recommend using the [official Invoke Launcher](#invoke-launcher).

{alternateLaunchers.map(({title, description, href}) => (
  <LinkCard
    title={title}
    description={description}
    href={href}
  />
))}
