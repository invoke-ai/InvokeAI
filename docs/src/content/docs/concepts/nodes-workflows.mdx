## What are Nodes?

A **Node** is simply a single operation that takes in inputs and returns outputs. Multiple nodes can be linked together to create more complex functionality. All InvokeAI features are added through nodes.

With nodes, you can easily extend the image generation capabilities of InvokeAI and build workflows that suit your specific needs.

### Anatomy of a Node

Individual nodes are made up of the following:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Inputs" icon="left-arrow">
    Edge points on the **left side** of the node window where you connect outputs from other nodes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Outputs" icon="right-arrow">
    Edge points on the **right side** of the node window where you connect to inputs on other nodes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Options" icon="setting">
    Various options which are either manually configured, or overridden by connecting an output from another node to the input.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
