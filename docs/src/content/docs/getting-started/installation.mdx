### Install Invoke

Run the Launcher you just set up if you haven't already. Click **Install** and follow the instructions to install (or update) Invoke.

If you have an existing Invoke installation, you can select it and let the launcher manage the install. You'll be able to update or launch the installation.

<Aside type="note" title="Updating">
  The Launcher will check for updates for itself _and_ Invoke.

  - When the Launcher detects an update is available for itself, you'll get a small popup window. Click through this and the Launcher will update itself.
  - When the Launcher detects an update for Invoke, you'll see a small green alert in the Launcher. Click that and follow the instructions to update Invoke.

## Stability Matrix

Stability Matrix is an all-in-one manager for many image generation packages, including Invoke.

<Aside type="caution">
  The Stability Matrix installation is not managed by Invoke, so we cannot guarantee it will work correctly. If you want a more stable experience, we recommend using the [official Invoke Launcher](#invoke-launcher).
