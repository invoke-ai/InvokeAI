# Main release workflow. Triggered on tag push or manual trigger.
#
# - Runs all code checks and tests
# - Verifies the app version matches the tag version.
# - Builds the installer and build, uploading them as artifacts.
# - Publishes to TestPyPI and PyPI. Both are conditional on the previous steps passing and require a manual approval.
#
# See docs/RELEASE.md for more information on the release process.
